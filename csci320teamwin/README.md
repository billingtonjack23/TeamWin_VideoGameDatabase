# csci320teamwin
team win project for CSCI320

We created a relational database using Python and postgreSQL that compiles a wealth of information on video
games all in one place. We store
the genre, developer, publisher,
rating, release date and more! All
data we manipulate can and will be
printed on the command line and
not through a custom GUI.
